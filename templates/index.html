Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.", "Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.", "We know you will overcome this kind of situation. There is nothing we ever wanted right now, but your healing and fast recovery. Get better soon!", "It isn’t always easy, but when you’re not feeling well, I hope it helps to know others are thinking of you, and hoping that you’ll be better very soon. Take good care of yourself.", "Recovery is hard work – but you’re not alone. Not a day goes by that you aren’t thought of and wished well", "If you’re going through hell, keep going.", "Only in the darkness can you see the stars.", "When you have lost hope, you have lost everything. And when you think all is lost, when all is dire and bleak, there is always hope.", "Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today.", "A woman is like a tea bag: You never know how strong it is until it’s in hot water.", "There is an alchemy in sorrow. It can be transmuted into wisdom, which, if it does not bring joy, can yet bring happiness.", "The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, not to worry about the future, or not to anticipate troubles, but to live the present moment wisely and earnestly.", "If you wouldst live long, live well; for folly and wickedness shorten life.", "The time to relax is when you don’t have time for it.", "A purpose of human life, no matter who is controlling it, is to love whoever is around to be loved.", "The secret of life, though, is to fall seven times and to get up eight times. ", "Time is priceless, but it’s free. You can’t own it, you can use it. You can spend it. But you can’t keep it.

I live each day like it’s my first, and I can’t wait for the next one.", "Healing takes courage, and we all have courage, even if we have to dig a little to find it.", "Healing yourself is connected with healing others.", "The wound is the place where the Light enters you.", "The most important thing is to enjoy your life ― to be happy ― it’s all that matters.", "Whatever condition we are in, we must always do what we want to do, and if we want to go on a journey, then we must do so and not worry about our condition, even if it's the worst possible condition, because, if it is, we're finished anyway, whether we go on the journey or not, and it's better to die having made the journey we're been longing for than to be stifled by our longing.", "Others imply that they know what it is like to be depressed because they have gone through a divorce, lost a job, or broken up with someone. But these experiences carry with them feelings. Depression, instead, is flat, hollow, and unendurable. It is also tiresome. People cannot abide being around you when you are depressed. They might think that they ought to, and they might even try, but you know and they know that you are tedious beyond belief: you are irritable and paranoid and humorless and lifeless and critical and demanding and no reassurance is ever enough. You're frightened, and you're frightening, and you're not at all like yourself but will be soon, but you know you will not.", "The lotus is the most beautiful flower, whose petals open one by one. But it will only grow in the mud. In order to grow and gain wisdom, first you must have the mud --- the obstacles of life and its suffering. ... The mud speaks of the common ground that humans share, no matter what our stations in life. ... Whether we have it all or we have nothing, we are all faced with the same obstacles: sadness, loss, illness, dying and death. If we are to strive as human beings to gain more wisdom, more kindness and more compassion, we must have the intention to grow as a lotus and open each petal one by one. ", "An affirmation to say everyday: The healing power of God is working in me right now. Every day I get better and better in every way.", "The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? Though an army encamps against me, my heart shall not fear; though war rise up against me, yet I will be confident.", "Good humor is a tonic for mind and body. It is the best antidote for anxiety and depression. It is a business asset. It attracts and keep friends. It lightens human burdens. It is the direct route to serenity and contentment.", "With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts.", "When the ride is rough, people often get sick. Hold on to your grip and you will reach your destination.", "Never let the things you cannot do prevent you from doing the things you can.", "Nothing is more beautiful than a real smile that has struggled through tears.", "Those you love will go through hard times. Don’t give up on them. Patience + Caring + Empathy = Love.", "We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope.", "One cannot live the afternoon of life according to the program of life’s morning; for what was great in the morning will be of little importance in the evening, and what in the morning was true will at evening have become a lie. ", "The world is in a constant conspiracy against the brave. It’s the age-old struggle — the roar of the crowd on one side and the voice of your conscience on the other. ", "Look at a stone cutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred-and-first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not the last blow that did it, but all that had gone before.", "How surely gravity’s law, strong as an ocean current, takes hold of even the smallest thing and pulls it toward the heart of the world…This is what the things can teach us: to fall, patiently to trust our heaviness.

Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.", "Nothing is more destined to create deep-seated anxieties in people than the false assumption that life should be free of anxieties.", "The truth that many people never understand is that the more you try to avoid suffering, the more you suffer, because smaller and more insignificant things begin to torture you, in proportion to your fear of being hurt.", "Consider the redwood tree. When only a stump remains, the tree can nevertheless regenerate. Little sprouts shoot up from the buds of ancient, invisible roots and actually form a circle surrounding the old stump. This is a 'cathedral circle,' and the survival of some of the buds guarantees that the redwoods do not die.", "Hope doesn't require a massive chain where heavy links of logic hold it together. A thin wire will do...just strong enough to get us through the night until the winds die down.", "The world is more magical, less predictable, more autonomous, less controllable, more varied, less simple, more infinite, less knowable, more wonderfully troubling than we could have imagined being able to tolerate when we were young."]
